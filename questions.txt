how to push?

I know how to clone:
	create a repository in github first.
	using command git clone <url> to clone 
I know how to push:
	after I clone an repository using clone command,
	I made some change to the file.
	I use command git push -u origin master to push the changed file to GitHub.
I know how to pull:
	in order to keep track of newest version on the server,
	we need pull command to pull the newest version from Web to local computer.
	Just use git pull.
